*fMRIDenoise* is tool for automatic denoising, denoising strategies comparisons,
and functional connectivity data quality control.
The goal of fMRIDenoise is to provide an objective way to select
best-performing denoising strategy given the data.
The tool is designed to work directly on `fMRIPrep <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io>`_-preprocessed datasets and
data in `BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_ standard.
We believe that the tool can make the selection of the denoising strategy more objective and also help researchers to obtain FC quality control metrics with almost no effort.

**The project is in beta stage and we are looking for feedback and collaborators.**
